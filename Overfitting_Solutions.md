# Overfitting Solutions for SSL_MAE

This document outlines the changes made to address the overfitting issue in the SSL_MAE model, where the validation accuracy was consistently 1.0 (100%) and validation loss was 0.0.

## Problem Analysis

The model was experiencing severe overfitting, as evidenced by:
- Perfect validation accuracy (1.0) from the first epoch
- Zero validation loss
- Higher training loss compared to validation loss

This indicated that the model was not generalizing well and was likely memorizing the training data or experiencing data leakage between training and validation sets.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Increased Regularization

#### Weight Decay
Added weight decay to the optimizer to penalize large weights:
```python
# In config.py
self.weight_decay = 0.01  # Weight decay for regularization

# In train.py
optimizer = optim.AdamW(
    filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters()),
    lr=config.learning_rate,
    weight_decay=config.weight_decay
)
```

#### Increased Dropout
Increased dropout probability to reduce co-adaptation of neurons:
```python
# In config.py
self.dropout_p = 0.7  # Increased from 0.5
```

### 2. Early Stopping

Implemented early stopping to prevent the model from overfitting during training:
```python
# In config.py
self.use_early_stopping = True
self.patience = 5
self.min_delta = 0.001

# In train.py
if config.use_early_stopping:
    if val_metrics['val_loss'] < best_val_loss - config.min_delta:
        best_val_loss = val_metrics['val_loss']
        patience_counter = 0
        best_model_state = model.state_dict().copy()
    else:
        patience_counter += 1
        if patience_counter >= config.patience:
            print(f"Early stopping triggered after {epoch} epochs")
            # Restore best model
            model.load_state_dict(best_model_state)
            break
```

### 3. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA

Enabled Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by default to reduce the number of trainable parameters:
```python
# In config.py
self.use_lora = True
self.freeze_strategy = "backbone_only"
self.lora_r = 4  # Small rank for small datasets
```

### 4. Simplified Model Architecture

Reduced the projection head dimension to prevent overfitting:
```python
# In config.py
self.proj_dim = 128  # Reduced from 384
self.recon_weight = 0.0  # Disabled reconstruction loss
```

### 5. Cross-Validation

Implemented k-fold cross-validation to get a more reliable estimate of model performance:
```python
# In config.py
self.use_cross_validation = True
self.n_folds = 5

# In train.py
if config.use_cross_validation:
    # Initialize k-fold cross-validation
    kf = KFold(n_splits=config.n_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)
    
    # Train on each fold
    for fold_idx, (train_indices, val_indices) in enumerate(kf.split(range(len(full_dataset)))):
        # Create train and validation datasets for this fold
        train_subset = Subset(full_dataset, train_indices)
        val_dataset = MorphDataset(
            [file_paths[i] for i in val_indices],
            [labels[i] for i in val_indices],
            transform=test_transform,
            metadata=[metadata[i] for i in val_indices]
        )
        
        # Train on this fold
        model, fold_metric = train_fold(
            train_subset, val_dataset, config, device, log_file, seed, fold_idx
        )
```

## How to Use the New Features

### Running with Default Settings

The default settings now include all the anti-overfitting measures:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

### Disabling Cross-Validation

If you want to disable cross-validation:

```bash
python src/train.py --override use_cross_validation=False
```

### Adjusting Early Stopping

To adjust early stopping patience:

```bash
python src/train.py --override patience=10
```

### Adjusting Regularization

To adjust dropout and weight decay:

```bash
python src/train.py --override dropout_p=0.6 --override weight_decay=0.005
```

## Expected Results

With these changes, you should see:
- More realistic validation accuracy (less than 1.0)
- Validation loss that fluctuates and eventually decreases
- Better generalization to unseen data
- More reliable performance estimates through cross-validation

## Monitoring for Overfitting

Continue to monitor for signs of overfitting:
- Large gap between training and validation loss
- Validation loss that increases over time
- Validation accuracy that is suspiciously high

If you observe these signs, consider:
- Further increasing regularization
- Reducing model complexity
- Collecting more diverse training data
